# Russian YouTube Trending Trash List
A list of Russian YouTube channels that often appear on YouTube's Trending page (more than 9,500 channels listed).

## What is it?
This is a collection of Russian YouTube channels that show up in the Trending section. 
The list was started in August 2020 and has been updated regularly since then.

> **Note:** These channels are only blocked from the Trending sections like Music, Gaming, and Movies.

## What gets blocked?
A channel will be added to the block list if it features:

- **Russian propaganda**
- **Esotericism or mysticism**
- **Casinos or gambling**
- Kids gaming content
- Silly or cringe short videos
- Fights or football clips
- Non-Russian and non-English content
- Overly commercial pop music

To block these channels, I use the [BlockTube](https://github.com/amitbl/blocktube) browser extension:

- [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blocktube/bbeaicapbccfllodepmimpkgecanonai)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/blocktube/)

The extension’s source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/amitbl/blocktube).

## Disclaimer
You might not agree with this list — your favorite channel could be on it.
