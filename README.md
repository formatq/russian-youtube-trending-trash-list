# Russian Youtube Trends Trash List
A trash list of Russian Youtube channels that appear in Youtube trends (>3000 blocked channels)


You may not like this sheet because your favorite YouTube channel will be there.

YouTube channels are blocked only from the Trends block (now, music, gaming, movies).
The list began to be compiled somewhere in August 2020. Since then, it has been regularly updated.
What gets banned: fights, football, esotericism, shorts, Russian propaganda, children's gaming, Uzbek (and so on) content, pop music.

The Google Chrome browser extension is used for blocking - [Blocktube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blocktube/bbeaicapbccfllodepmimpkgecanonai) (for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/blocktube /)).
The source code of the BlockTube extension is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/amitbl/blocktube )
