# Russian YouTube Trending Trash List
A trash list of Russian YouTube channels that appears in YouTube's Trending (over 9000 channels are listed).

# What is it?
This is a list of Russian YouTube channels that appear in YouTube Trending. The list started to be compiled sometime in
August 2020. Since then, it has been regularly updated.

YouTube's channels are blocked only from the Trending page (now, music, gaming, movies). 

# What gets banned?
Channel will be banned if it has: 
- **russian propaganda**
- **esotericism**
- **casino**
- children's gaming
- silly/cringe clip-on short videos
- fights and football videos
- non-russian and non-english content
- very pop music

To block channels, I use the [BlockTube](https://github.com/amitbl/blocktube) browser extension 
([Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blocktube/bbeaicapbccfllodepmimpkgecanonai) / 
[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/blocktube/)). 
The source code of the extension is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/amitbl/blocktube).

# Disclaimer
You might not like this list because one of your favourite YouTube channels might be on it.
