# Russian Youtube Trends Trash List
The trash list of Russian Youtube channels that appears in Youtube-trends (about 3500 channels are blocked)


# What is it?
This is the trash list of Russian Youtube channels that appear in Youtube trends. The list began to be compiled somewhere in August 2020. Since then, it has been regularly updated.

YouTube channels are blocked only from the Trends block (now, music, gaming, movies). What gets banned: fights, football, esotericism, shorts, Russian propaganda, children's gaming, Non-russian and non-english content, pop music.

To block channels, I use the [BlockTube](https://github.com/amitbl/blocktube) browser extension ([Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blocktube/bbeaicapbccfllodepmimpkgecanonai) / [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/blocktube/)). The source code of the extension is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/amitbl/blocktube)

# Disclaimer
You may not like that list, because one of your favorite YouTube-channel might be there.
