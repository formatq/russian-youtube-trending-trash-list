# Russian Youtube Trends Trash List
A trash list of Russian Youtube channels that appear in Youtube trends (>3000 blocked channels)


# What is it?
This is the trash list of Russian Youtube channels that appear in Youtube trends. The list began to be compiled somewhere in August 2020. Since then, it has been regularly updated.

YouTube channels are blocked only from the Trends block (now, music, gaming, movies). What gets banned: fights, football, esotericism, shorts, Russian propaganda, children's gaming, Uzbek (and so on) content, pop music.

To block channels, I use the [BlockTube](https://github.com/amitbl/blocktube) browser extension ([Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blocktube/bbeaicapbccfllodepmimpkgecanonai) / [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/blocktube/)). The source code of the extension is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/amitbl/blocktube)

# Disclaimer
You may not like this list, because your favorite YouTube channel will be there.
