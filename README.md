# Russian YouTube Trending Trash List
The trash list of Russian YouTube channels that appears in YouTube's Trending (about 5000 channels are in the list).

# What is it?
This is a list of Russian YouTube channels that appear in YouTube Trending. The list began to be compiled somewhere in 
August 2020. Since then, it has been regularly updated.

YouTube's channels are blocked only from the Trending page (now, music, gaming, movies). 

# What gets banned?
Channel will be banned if it has: 
- **russian propaganda**
- **esotericism**
- children's gaming
- only shorts videos
- fights and football videos
- non-russian and non-english content
- very pop music

To block channels, I use the [BlockTube](https://github.com/amitbl/blocktube) browser extension 
([Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blocktube/bbeaicapbccfllodepmimpkgecanonai) / 
[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/blocktube/)). 
The source code of the extension is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/amitbl/blocktube).

# Disclaimer
You may not like that list, because one of your favorite YouTube-channel might be there.
